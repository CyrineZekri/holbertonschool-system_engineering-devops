Answers to Questions: 
1/ The Load balancer is configured at Round Robin, it evenly distributes requests between servers
2/Active-Active set-up :
all servers in the backend are actively handling incoming requests simultaneously
the load balancer distributes the incoming traffic across all available servers in an even manner 
This mode allows the system to handle higher volume of traffic and provides better resource utilization
3/ The replica nodes are read-only copies of the data from the primary node.
When it recieves a write operation, such as : insert, update or delete, it sends the request to the primary node
The replica nodes keep their data consistent by pulling the replication log on the primary node  
4/Replica nodes accept read-only requests
primary node executes write requests 

Issues with this infrastructure: 
- it still has a single point of failure: the load balancer
- There is no monitoring 
- The communications are not secure
