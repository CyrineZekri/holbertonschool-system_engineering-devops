# Web Infrastructure Design - README

Welcome to the Web Infrastructure Design project! In this project, we will explore various essential concepts related to web infrastructure, network basics, servers, monitoring, databases, load balancers, DNS, and more. The goal is to create a robust and highly available web infrastructure that ensures smooth operations and minimal downtime.

## Network Basics
Learn about the fundamental concepts of networking, including IP addresses, routers, switches, and how data is transmitted over a network.

## Server
Understand the role of servers in web infrastructure and how they handle client requests, process data, and manage resources.

## Web Server
Explore the purpose and functionality of web servers in delivering web content and handling HTTP requests.

## DNS (Domain Name System)
Discover how DNS translates domain names into IP addresses and how it enables users to access websites using human-readable names.

## Load Balancer
Learn about load balancers, their role in distributing incoming traffic among multiple servers, and ensuring high availability and scalability.

## Monitoring
Understand the importance of monitoring web infrastructure and the tools used to collect and analyze system metrics.

## What is a Database
Get an overview of databases, their types (e.g., relational, NoSQL), and their role in storing and managing data.

## Web Server vs. App Server
Distinguish between web servers and application servers, understanding their respective roles in the web application architecture.

## DNS Record Types
Explore different DNS record types, such as A, CNAME, MX, and more, and their purposes in DNS configuration.

## Single Point of Failure
Identify single points of failure in a system and learn how to mitigate their impact to ensure high availability.

## How to Avoid Downtime When Deploying New Code
Implement best practices and strategies to avoid downtime during the deployment of new code updates.

## High Availability Cluster (Active-Active/Active-Passive)
Learn about high availability clusters and their configurations, including active-active and active-passive setups.

## What is HTTPS
Understand the importance of HTTPS (HTTP Secure) in providing secure communication over the internet.

## What is a Firewall
Discover the role of firewalls in network security and how they control incoming and outgoing traffic to protect systems.

We hope you find this project informative and insightful. By understanding these concepts, you will be well-equipped to design a resilient and efficient web infrastructure that can handle the demands of modern web applications.

Happy learning and building!
